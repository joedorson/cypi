# cypi

Cypi is a Raspbery Pi infused robot (Cybot). The robot, Cybot came from a 90's magazine called Real Robots where you built and programed a robot. Cypi is intended to be used to learn programming and how to interact with the outside world via sensors.

** Disclaimer **
Cypi is intended as a project for me to learn a whole host of new skils. From programming to electronics. Please take into consideration that there may be erros within the code and this tutorial.
